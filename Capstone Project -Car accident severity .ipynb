The model aims to predict the severity of an accident, considering that, the variable of Severity Code was in the form of *1* (Property Damage Only) and *2* (Physical Injury) which were encoded to the form of *0* (Property Damage Only) and *1* (Physical Injury). Following that, *0* was assigned to the element of each variable which can be the least probable cause of severe accident whereas a high number represented adverse condition which can lead to a higher accident severity. Whereas, there were unique values for every variable which were either *Other* or *Unknown*, deleting those rows entirely would have led to a lot of loss of data which is not preferred."
